# Free-Spoken-Digit-Task-Kaldi
This project uses the Kaldi toolkit to build an HMM-GMM based for the free spoken digit task, in which we try to detect and classify spoken digits (0-9) from Kaggle database Free Spoken Digit Task (https://www.kaggle.com/joserzapata/free-spoken-digit-dataset-fsdd)

## Data



## Preprocessing

One of the tools provided in the Kaggle task made easy to assign each recording to train/test sets. Python file preprocessing.py (python_src/preprocessing.py) does just this train/test split. 

## Kaldi training

## Results

In this simple task, the best result is a Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.00%, which means a perfect transcription for each audio was obtained.
